"Orange Cat" is a game in which you play as a mischievous cat. The objective of the game is to cause as much destruction as possible by jumping on furniture and breaking objects in a house. The more destruction you cause, the more points you earn.

The game is a continuous loop, meaning that the house layout is the same every time you play. This feature ensures that players can continue to play the game indefinitely . It also allows players to improve their scores by learning the layout of the house and becoming more efficient in causing destruction.

To maximize your score in "Orange Cat," you need to focus on breaking as many objects as possible. Although navigating the house is important, breaking objects earns more points.
