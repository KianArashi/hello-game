# hello game
 
In the game "Orange Cat," you play as a mischievous feline who wreaks havoc on a house by jumping on furniture and destroying objects. As you progress through the game, your speed increases and your purring intensifies. You earn more points for breaking objects than for simply navigating the house. The goal is to cause as much destruction as possible within the confines of the house, which is depicted as a continuous loop.
